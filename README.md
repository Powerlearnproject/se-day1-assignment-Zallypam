Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering refers to  the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software ensuring that software is reliable, scalable, and efficient while meeting user requirements.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.1968 – The Birth of Software Engineering
2. 1970s – Structured Programming & Waterfall Model
3. 2001 – Agile Manifesto

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement analysis phrase -this involves gathering user requirements.
2. Planning –this phase involves estimating resources, cost, and timeline that will be needed to make the softwae a success.
3. Design – this phase involves creating system architecture and UI/UX wireframes that meets the user softwre requirements.
4. Implementation– this phase  entails the writing of the actual code.
5. Testing – this phase entails identifying and fixing bugs in the code.
6. Deployment – this phase entails releasing the software for end-users to interract with freely and send feedbacks.
7. Maintenance –it entails updates, bug fixes, and support.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: Writes, debugs, and maintains code.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software to find defects.
3. Project Manager : Oversees timelines, resources, and coordination.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments provides code completion,debugging and code automation coding spaces an example is the VS code,PyCharm.
2. it entails tracking changes in a system ,allowing collaboaration and enable rollbacks.example are github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Not well structured project scoop
2. Debugging Complex Code
3. Keeping Up with New Technological evolutions over the years.
4. poor team Communication Issues

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing –It involves testing of individual functions or components.
2. Integration Testing – It ensures that different project modules work together efficiently.
3. System Testing – Involves testing the complete application as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing –It confirms the software meets user requirements as initially defined.
  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective queries or instructions to get the best responses from AI models like ChatGPT.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective
